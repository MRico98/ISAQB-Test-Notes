# Kiss, YAGNI and DRY

## Kiss
Kiss -> Keep it simple and strighforward
TAGNI -> you arent gfoing to need it

* Complexity kills sytem
    * Easier to compehend and to maintain
    * Less error prone

Make things as simple as possibkle, but not simples

## Considerations and challenges of KISS and yagni
* Inability to predict the futureu
    * If the design is too simple, future changes may be dificutl to make
    * If the design is too felxible, the system will be extra complex

* Simplicity vs performance
    * Perfomance optimizations may make the design more complex
    * Consider the necesity of those optimizations

## The DRY principle

Dot repeat yoursel
Avoid diplicated code, data or reponsabilities

WET - Waste everyones Time

## Considerations of DRY
* Dry increases coupling

## Summary
* Kiss
* YAGNI
    * Main motivator:
        * Easier to understand and matinaint
* DRY
    * Avoid duplication of code, data and responsabilities
