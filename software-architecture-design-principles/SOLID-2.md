# SOLID Principles - Part 2

## Interface Segratation Princple
Clients should no be forced to depend on methods they do not use
    * Multple small and specific interfaces are better thana  single, large one
    * SPlit large interfaces by semantics or by responsability

Dont exaggerate the use of this principle
* Observe the KISS princple
* Group clinets into categories

## Dependency inversion
* High level modules should not depend on low level modules
    * Both should depend on abstracitons

* Abstraction should not depend on concrete implemetnations

## Summary
Finished learning the SOLID principles
* Interface segratation princple
* Dependency inversion principle
