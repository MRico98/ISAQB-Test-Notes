# Murplys law, pastel law

## Expected errors
Anything that can go wrong will go wrong

Anticipate eerrors:
    * What do i penden on?
    * What can possibly fo wrong?

Contain the error:
    * Checking erro status
    * Exception handling


## Robustness Principle
Be conservative in what you do, be liberanm in what you accept from others

* Be precise and strict when designing your compoents, but:
    * Tolarate errors in other componets
    * Be able to recover from errores
    * Degrade gracefully

* System that expend a lot of inputs are highly complex
* Performacne overhead

## Summary
* Expected errors/murphys law
* Robustness princples - Postel law
