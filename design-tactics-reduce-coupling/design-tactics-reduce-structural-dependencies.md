# Tactics to reduce coupling in structural dependencies

## Types of structural dependencies

A component is direclyt relient on the structure or design of another component

Componetns in B affects componets A

1. Inheritance - the highest type of coupling
2. Type Usage - Use type sin signature or in general in the class

## Tactics to habndlde coupling

1. Use plymorphism
2. Facede pattern
3. Decoratoir pattern
    * Differnet componetns canc reate differnte combinations of decorators

## Summary
* Learned how to reduce coupling in structural dependencies
* Types of structural dependenices
* Inheritance - tight couplign
