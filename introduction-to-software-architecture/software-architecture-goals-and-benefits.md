# Definition of Sfotwarea and Software Intensive Systems

## What is software?
Softawre is nos just code, but multiple programs and procedures working together. Also data with associated documentation.

## When software architecture is important?
Software archictecute is not very important for
* Small, simpel and short lived software

A software intensive system is a system for which software is a major technical challenge and is perhaps the major factor that affectes system scheduel, costs and risk

## Whatd oes sofrtare architectue provide for software intenstive systems
* Software archicteure ios about the structure/organization of a softare syustem
* It imptacts the system wualities

* Software architecture is the resutl of numerosu design decisions

## Principles for good architecuture
* Useful
* Stable
* Graceful

## Goals for a good software architecture
- Creates a meaningful division of a componentes
- Specifies necessary implementaiton measures
- Defines design guidlints to ensure conceptual integrity
- DEsocumends and provides rationale for design decision

## Benefits of Good softrware architecture
- Shows that functional and wuality requirments will or can be fullfilled
- Helps the stakehodlers to understand the system
- Helps reuse components
- Ensure system longevity facilite system maintence

## Complexity
Degree to wichc a syustem design or code is dificult to understand becouse of numerous component or relanthishops among components

Amount of human effor required to understand something in order to change or extend it

## Short and long term goals

Project goals And software architecture gosl both wnat functional requiriements quality product

PG wans Short tems goals
SA wants long term goals

## Summary

Principles of architecture from ancient Rome:
* Useful
* Reliable
* Graceful

Goals and benefits of software architecture

Complexity
* Amount of uman effot required to understand something in ordet to change/extend it
* Kills systems

* Relathionship between
    * Long term goals
    * Short term operational goals
