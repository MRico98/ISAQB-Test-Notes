# Origins of Software Architecture

* Greek -> Master builder

## Origins of software archictecture

Bafore 1960
- Hadware was complex
- Software was simple

Invention of the integrated circuits
Start the software crisis in the 1960s
- Improving in computing power outpaced the ability of engineer to construct "good" IT sytems
    - On Time
    - Within budget
-> High failure

## Do we really Need software architecture
- To Exprensive
- Slows us down
- The truth is the code

## Consequence of lack of software architecture
* Low qualuity product
* Porly structurated softarte that is hard to mantain
* Dauting for exsitisnt developers
* Difficutl for new developers to learn

# Intuition for good software architecture

Softwrae architecture depends on mnya factors liike
* Environment
* Scale
* Customers
* Budget

nyathing missed -> Reqruimrents not meet

Summary
- Motifccation for software architecture
- We need architectuer to avoid
    * Expensive
    * Disruptive
    Change in the future
- Origins of software archite ture
- Intuition for good software archituecture
