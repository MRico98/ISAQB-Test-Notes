# Definitions of software architectrue

* Theres no oficial definition

ANSI/IEEE 1471

Software archictercuter ANSI/IEEE 1471
The fundamental organization of a system embodied in its component, their relationships to each other and the enviroment

Architecture ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010
Fundamentals concepts or properties of a system in tis envorment embodied in its elements, relationships and in the principles

## Definitions of Software Archictecture

Four elements
* Building bloks
* Relationships between building blocks
* Relationships between building blocks and the enviroments
* Principles, rules and guidelines

## Building block / Component

* Entity with discrete structure, such as an assembly or software module
* unit of hierachial compositon and encapsulation
* Component prpvider structure

# Block/White box components

* Black box
    - Input
    - outpu
    - Quality attributes

* White box

## interfaces in software architecture
* Components do things with each other -> Dynacmic systemn behavior
* Shared bondary between two functional units, defined by varios characteristics pertaining to the functions

### Interfaces examples
* Java interfaces
* Web applicatons
* Rest, gRPC

- Interfaces imply
    - Connections
    - Relationshops
    
## Types of interface

- Provider interface

Most common type of interface
API

- Required Interface
Service provider interface

- Standard interface
Consumer and provider depend on that interface

## Summary
There are many validations definitons of software architecture

Comomoin concepts:
- Building block
- Relation between blokcs
- Relation between blocks and environments
