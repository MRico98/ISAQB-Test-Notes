# Microservices Architecture

## motifaction

* Monolithi architecture i perfect for simple
* As thje size and complexity of our docebase grow, it becomes difiuclt to troubleshout

* We jave problems in organizational scalibility becose the mroe engineer we add to the team the more code merge conflict we get

## Microservices
* Divide large systems into small units

* Easier to understand and devlop
* Faster to build, test and load in the IDE
* Simplet to troubleshoot

## Best practices of using microservices
1. Single respoinsabiulities principels
    Each servieces need to be responsiblity only for one domain
2. Separated database per service

## pros and cons of pipes
Pro
* Improve changeability and flexibility
* Decople technology decisions
* Multiple versions of a service can coexist
* Good scalability
* Fast development, short time to market

Con
* All CONs of distributed computing
* more sophiscated error handling
* More complex deployment/operations
* Dependency resolution at runtime may cause hard to find errors

## Summary
* Microservices architecture
* Our system is structured as small runtime units
